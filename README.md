**A dashboard utilizing data analysis, interactivity, and visualization to enhance sustainable water use, leveraging datasets from the [Testing Ag Performance Solutions (TAPS)](https://www.k-state.edu/taps/) program**
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo

## üî¢ Data
- **Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)**: Provided by Ceres Imaging
- **Management Data**: Collected by TAPS 
- **Soil Moisture Content (SMC)**: Measured using neutron probes.
- **Weather Data**: Sourced from [Kansas Mesonet](https://mesonet.k-state.edu/)

## üöÄ Features Overview
- Displays a geosatellite map with either a CWSI or SMC heat map overlay, selectable by the user.
- Highlights field plots experiencing water stress, allowing users to identify plots with the highest and lowest water stress levels.
- Enables users to click on individual plots to access detailed information about crop water status.
- Provides time series information based on a selected date, including irrigation, precipitation, water deficit, and water excess.
- Shows the water required by plants on a selected date and tracks cumulative irrigation from the beginning of the planting season up to that date.
- Uses OpenAI to generate actionable summaries from dashboard insights, offering users a quick, high-level overview of plot-specific conditions.
